# RMTEstimCovDist
Code that gives the RMT Improved distances between covariances.

The code contains the following scripts and functions

A function RMTEstCovDist that takes as input the samples X and Y (of the two distribution from which the distance will be computed) and the type of distance (Fisher,Battacharrya,KL,Wasserstein) and returns the proposed estimates est as well as the classical estimate esthat.

A script CompareEst which compares the proposed estimates and the classical one.

A script CLusteringCov which performs the clustering over covariances.
